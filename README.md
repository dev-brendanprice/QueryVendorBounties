# QueryVendorBounties
**This tool is used to query all the bounties that a vendor is able to sell. Follow the below steps to learn how to use it.**

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open `index.html` in the browser.
3. Open the browser dev console (Ctrl+Shift+i) on the page that comes up.
4. Open the directory in VSC, or an IDE of your choice.
5. Go into `labels.js` and copy the hash (number) from the vendor that you want to query bounties for.
6. Go into `index.js` and paste the copied hash into the function, on `Line: 5`

**Note:** *I recommend that you use the "Live Server" VSC extension to automatically refresh the page when you make a change to the code. This just makes the entire process a lil' bit faster.*
