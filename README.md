# QueryVendorBounties

Query vendor bounties from the D2 API

1. Clone this repo to an environment such as XAMPP, Live Reload, or anything that is hosted on your local network
2. Open the directory and change the `VENDORHASH` variable in `index.js` to your desired vendor hash
3. Go to the URL that your environment is being hosted in (Most default to localhost:8080 or localhost:8000)
4. Open the dev console and there should be an array of items; the bounties from the chosen vendor

*If there is no array, refresh the browser and it should appear*
